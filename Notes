NOTES ON DELIVERABLES:

1. Format of GitHub Pages:
- index.html should just have a link to deliverable1.html, deliverable2.html, and deliverable 3.html.

2. Visualization:
- Make charts or graphs more readable
- Labels should be clean and tidy
- Print labels in plain English (Not just variable names)
- Make graphs look nice

3. Modeling:
- Don't obssess about models being perfect
- Mention results even if the result is "Variables are not good at predicting"
- These problems will need to be addressed in Deliverable 3 (Refining)
- Keep initial model ~initial~

4. Display Data:
- List your tibble: "my_tibble"
- This will display your new dataset and knit it to HTML
- Easier for viewers to see what data looks like in a more raw form

5. Making Deliverables Modular:
- "Purl source" chunk of Kevin's MusicInsights - ref page
- Will run the first deliverable for the viewer without them having to manually run it
- Essentially, they can just go to each deliverable separately without running anything but that one.
