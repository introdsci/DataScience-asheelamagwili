## Abstract

I am interested in looking into air pollution and the behavior of air pollutants over time. It would be interesting to see how this research relates to topics like climate change, wildlife, and depletion of the atmosphere.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

In the first deliverable, the data is introduced, cleaned, and processed. This phase focuses on understanding the data and making it readable for others to understand as well. 

### 2. Model Planning and Building

Coming soon...

### 3. Results and Operationalization

Coming soon...
